  <h1>Welcome to the website</h1>
  <h3>it works the same as trinket, but...</h3>
  <br><br>
  <h3>I'd (nat) say github is better since it:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> doesn't prevent you from running heavy stuff </li>
    <li> organizes your files instead of it being all on one file</li>
    <li> more efficient than running with trinket </li>
    <li> works as an actual website, made by you!</li>
  </ol>
